Tactics for Winning the game with a super high score

-General
    
      Stay at the top of the screen because planes can't hit you 
      and the ships dont come out much and you can dodge their
      bullets anyways.

     -2.0- Make sure you move around alot at the top to make sure 
     planes dont get you as fast.

-Planes
      
      -2.0-You want to do this really quick because the planes will turn around

      If you wanna get rid of a group of planes fast the get behind them,
      hold down your gun button then move up and down. This create a wave
      of bullets that would wipe out the group. But be sure that you dont 
      smack into some ship bullets along the way. 
      
      
      To bring down a plane you can also drop a bomb on it. Even though 
      that would be stupid cause you could just shoot them.

      Shooting one of these will give you +50 points

-Ships 
      
      Get as down far as you can and fly over the ship an drop a bomb. Sounds 
      Simple, but also be sure you dont smack into a ship bomb.

      Shooting one of these will give you +100 points.

-Subs
      
      To shoot a sub get as far as you can in front of it and then get as far down
       the screen as your allowed and then drop a *few* bombs. There is no danger
       in shooting theses alone, However you should watch out for crossfire from
       other units.

      Shooting one of these will give you +500 points.

-Osama's Ship 
 
      This is the easter egg. To get it you need over 1000 points and you need to
       press P.
       
      Do extacly what you do to a ship. Plus its even easier because he doesnt fire.
      And still watch out for crossfire.
       
      Shooting Osama will get you no points but some laughs..
           

-Health Box's
     
      Health box's are just regular box's that fall from the sky. It you hit one you
      gain +10 HP and +200 score.

 :P Good luck on the game and hope you can get something over 5000
